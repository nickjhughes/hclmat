A collection of functions to make using HCL colours in MATLAB easier. See the comments at the top of each file for documentation.

Functions
=========

- rgb2lum: calculate the luminance value of an sRGB triple
- hcl2rgb: convert a HCL triple to its corresponding sRGB triple
- hcl_colormap: provide a HCL colormap in the same form as MATLAB's built-in colormaps
- hcl_jet_colormap: provide a non-periodic HCL colormap in the same form as MATLAB's built-in colormaps
- mhcl_colormap: provide an mHCL (modulated HCL) colormap in the same form as MATLAB's built-in colormaps
- color_mapping_gui.m/.fig/*_map.mat: a GUI for exploring the effects of colormaps on the visualisation of orientation preference maps
